Awesome music discovery and DJ broadcaster project for HCI

First, install Node.js (nodejs.org). 
Then, install the latest Cordova and Ionic command-line tools (https://www.npmjs.org/package/ionic). 

$ npm install -g cordova ionic

Once installed, go into mobileweb/soneme folder. In there run:

ionic serve


That should start the prototype.

Try dragging around the albums both down to the queue, and into the center. Explore the menu to find DJs and to search for new songs.
